# ID2223_project
In this project we will predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in several mediterranean cities such as Naples, Rome, Barcelona, and Athens (locations may be changed).  We will parse the public available Air Quality data from World Air Quality Index. Then, as proposed in the project instructions we will 1) collect historical weather and air quality data for the metioned locations (3) train a model with acceptable performance (such as 
XGBoost, or random forest) that uses both historical weather data and air quality 
measurements to predict future air quality (using future weather predictions)
(4) build a Hugging Face space to see the predictions of air quality 
for the mentioined locations for the next 7 days
